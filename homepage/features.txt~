Features
========

GCBoard has many features that are usually found in chess interfaces
(e.g. XBoard), including:

* An easy to use programming interface
* Automatic support for:
    - clicking to move
    - dragging pieces with the mouse
    - animating moves
    - flashing pieces after the move
    - highlighting the last move
    - premove (planned)

    All these can be set on or off by setting a parameter.

* Placement of a piece using many parameters.
* Concept of numbered layers: you can add extra images in separate layers, they
  will be rendered correctly, using the layer number as a reference.
* Cross platform: adding new platforms and toolkits is very easy (see
  documentation).
* Fast animation (double buffered).  This makes the library usable
  with languages that have a slow interpreter.
* Support for more then one playboard or auxiliary boards, for example
  in _Shogi_ to place the captured pieces.
* Drawing the background and highlighting can be done automatically,
* or done by your application.
* Support for the [Gtk2][] toolkit.
* Support for [Ruby][] using [ruby-gtk2][]
