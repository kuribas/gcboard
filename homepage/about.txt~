**gcboard (Generic Chess Board)** is a programming library
implementing a graphical playing board for Chess
and Chesslike games.  It's very flexible, and can be used to program
many kinds of games (i.e. _Draughts, Japanese Chess, Chinese Chess,
Checkers_).  It implements most of the features that are usually found
in chess interfaces (dragging, highlighting, animating, flashing,
etc.) and handles them without additional effort for the programmer.
Gcboard will support your game if it has the following properties:

* The game is turn based (from 2 to 15 players).       
* Pieces are placed on one or more rectangular playing boards (usually
  one).
* Moves are made by moving a piece from it's square to another
  (either empty or containing an enemy piece).

For example, games that wouldn't fall into this cathegory: _go, othello,
monopoly, backgammon._

_GCBoard_ is **platform independent**.  The core of the library has
been written in C with portability in mind.  Supporting new platforms
and toolkits should be very easy: just create a wrapper around the
platform independent code.  Currently there is support for the
[Gtk2][gtk] toolkit.  Any contributions to support other toolkits
and platforms are certainly welkom! (e.g. MS Windows, Qt, Mac Os).

Since the base of the library is written in c, it is perfect for use
with (slow) scripting interpreters, for example _ruby, scheme, python and
perl_.  In fact this is one of the reasons I wrote this library.
Bindings exist for [Ruby][rb], and I contributions for other bindings
are certainly welcome.

My hope is that this library will encourge other people to write beautiful
games, without having to spend to much effort on writing the gui.
Instead of having to write a full interface each time from scratch,
_GCBoard_ makes it possible to concentrate on the game-specific parts.

_GCBoard_ is released under the [General Public Licence][gpl].
Basicly this means that you are free to use and modify this library as
long as you also release the sources to your program.  (**Note:** this
is not the LGPL license, it doesn't permit linking (either staticaly
or dynamicaly) with closed source programs.

I'd like to hear your opinion about gcboard, or requests of new
features.  If you know a feature or enhancement that is generally
usefull I will probably add it.

Gcboard is developed by Kristof Bastiaensen and hosted by [sourceforge][sf].  You can find the
