<li>highlighting last moves</li>
<li>premove (not finished)</li>
</ul>

<p><p>All these may be these may be turned off by the user.</p></li>
<li>Custom placement of pieces in the square. Automatic positioning in
one of the cardinal directions or centering.</li>
<li>A very powerful overlay system: You may add custom pixmaps to the
board in a layered fashion.  THey can be placed under the pieces or
over them.</li>

pieces), for example in <em>Shogi</em> to place the captured pieces.</li>
