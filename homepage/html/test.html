	<h1>About</h1>

	      <p><b>gcboard (Generic Chess Board)</b> is an easy to use
      gameboard API for Chess-style games (i.e. <em>Draughts, Shogi,
      Xiangqi, Checkers, Chess, </em>and variants).  It implements most of the
      expected features (dragging, highlighting, animating, flashing,
      ...), and handles them transparently for the programmer.  Gcboard
      will support your game if it has the following
      properties:
    <ul>
      <li>The game is turn based (from 2 to 15 players).</li>
      <li>Pieces are put on one or more rectangular grids (typically
	one).
      </li>
      <li>Moves are made by moving a piece from it's square to another
	(either empty or containing an enemy piece).
      </li>
    </ul>
    An example of games <b>not</b> supported: <em>go, othello, monopoly, backgammon</em>.
    </p>

    <p><em>gcboard</em> is <b>platform independent</b>.  The core of
      the library is written in (hopefully) portable C.  Supporting new
      platforms and toolkits should be very easy: only create a wrapper
      around the independent code.  Currently there is only a
      <b><a href="http://www.gtk.org">gtk+</a></b> widget.  A
      <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org">wxWindows</a> version will follow soon.
      Any contributions to support other toolkits and platforms are
      welkom! (i.e. MS Windows, Qt, Mac Os)</p>

    <p><em>gcboard</em> is especially optimized to be used with
    <b>interpreted languages</b>, such as <em>ruby, scheme, python and
    perl</em>.  Most of the cpu-intensive features are already
    implemented, so you can write your program in your favorite
    language, instead of having to write it in  C.  There
    are already bindings for <b><a
    href="http:/www.ruby-lang.org">ruby</a></b>, and I would gladly
    accept contributions for other bindings. </p>

    <p>The reason that I wrote this library is that other
      people can produce beautiful games, without much effort.  Instead
      of having to write a full interface each time from scratch, it
      is now possible to concentrate on the game-specific parts.</p>

    <p>gcboard is released under the
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">
	General Public Licence</a>.  Basicly this means that you are
	free to use and modify this library as long as you also
	release the sources to your program.  (<b>Note:</b> this is
	not the LGPL license, it doesn't permit linking (either
	staticaly or dynamicaly) with closed source programs.</p>

    <p>I would really like to hear your opinion about gcboard, or
      requests of new features.  If you know a feature or enhancement
      that is generally usefull I will probably add it.
    </p>

    <p>Gcboard is developed by Kristof Bastiaensen and hosted by <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a>.  You can find the
    project page <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcboard">here</a>.</p>
