Features
========

The goal of GCBoard has been to take the best features of the excellent XBoard
(WinBoard) program, or improving them when I felt necessary:

* Automatic support for:
    - clicking to move
    - dragging pieces with the mouse
    - animating moves
    - flashing pieces after the move
    - highlighting the last move
    - premove (planned)

    All these can be set on or off by setting a variable (which can be
    easily linked with the gui).

* An easy to use programming interface
* Automatic placement of a piece using many parameters.
* Concept of numbered layers: you can add extra images in separate layers, they
  will be rendered correctly, using the layer number as the stacking
  order.  It will eliminate the need to write extra code for adding
  elements to the graphical board.  It is as simple as taking a bitmap
  and putting it in the correct place.
* Cross platform: adding new platforms and toolkits is very easy (see
  documentation).
* Fast animation (double buffered).  This makes the library usable
  with languages that have a slow interpreter.
* Support for more then one playboard or auxiliary boards, for example
  in _Shogi_ to place the captured pieces.
* Drawing the background and highlighting can be done automatically,
  or done by your application.
* Support for the [Gtk2][] toolkit.
* Support for [Ruby][] using [ruby-gtk2][]
