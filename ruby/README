ABOUT Gtk::GCBoard for Ruby
===========================

Information about copying: see the file COPYING in
the parent directory.

These are the ruby bindings for the gtkcboard library.
I encourage everybody to write with this library 
in Ruby, because it development is easier, faster,
bugs can be solved faster, and there is no performance
penalty (since speed dependent features are already
implemented in this library).  An exception is the engine, 
but I believe it is better to separate
the interface from the engine.

For an example of using this library with an engine,
see the included demo.
